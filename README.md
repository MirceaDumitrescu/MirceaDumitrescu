# Hi there :wave:

My name is Mircea and i am 30 years old. I have played with code my entire life but only recently (2020) i have taken this seriously and got a job in the field.

I can trully say coding is my passion and my only regret is i have discovered this so late. But never say never and better late than never.

I am extremely dedicated and passionate about what i am doing and would love to learn even more, in a dedicated environment with a team formed by people with the same drive i have.
