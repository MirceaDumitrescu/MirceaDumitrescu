# Hi there :wave:

I’m currently an AEM Consultant at DHL, where I focus on building and optimizing web applications using Adobe Experience Manager, JavaScript, and frontend technologies. My role involves creating scalable, author-friendly components, improving site performance, and ensuring smooth integrations with backend services.

Outside of DHL, I run my own venture, SecretCode, where I work as a contractor on various web development projects. Over the years, I’ve had the chance to collaborate with different clients, tackling everything from AEM implementations to full-stack applications using React, Node.js, and more.

On top of that, I’ve also been a Frontend Instructor at NewTech Academy, where I taught JavaScript, CSS, HTML, Angular, and Node.js to aspiring developers. Teaching has been a great way to share my knowledge while also reinforcing my own skills—because let’s be honest, nothing makes you understand something better than explaining it to others!

I’m always exploring new technologies, refining my skills, and staying on top of industry trends. Whether it’s improving workflows in AEM, optimizing frontend performance, or diving into a new framework, I love the constant learning that comes with being a developer.
