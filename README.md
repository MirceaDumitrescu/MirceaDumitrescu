# Hi there :wave:

I’m an AEM Consultant and Full‑Stack Engineer specializing in building high‑performance, author‑friendly digital experiences. At DHL, I design and develop scalable AEM components (Core Components, Sling Models, HTL), optimize site performance, and integrate seamlessly with backend services and APIs. My day‑to‑day includes front‑end engineering with JavaScript/TypeScript, modern CSS, and performance tooling, with a strong focus on accessibility and maintainability.

In parallel, I lead SecretCode, my software consulting venture, where I architect and ship web and mobile applications end‑to‑end. I’ve delivered AEM implementations, React/Next.js frontends, Node.js/Express/NestJS services, and React Native mobile apps—owning everything from technical discovery and solution design to deployment, CI/CD, and observability. I thrive in fast feedback loops, measurable performance gains, and clear business outcomes.

Previously, as a Frontend Instructor at NewTech Academy, I taught JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Angular, and Node.js—mentoring aspiring developers and sharpening my own craft through teaching.

**Core skills and keywords:**

- Adobe Experience Manager (AEM Sites/Assets), Core Components, HTL, Sling Models, OSGi, Dispatcher/CDN tuning
- Frontend: JavaScript/TypeScript, React, Next.js, Angular, CSS architecture, Web Vitals, Lighthouse, bundle optimization
- Backend/Platform: Node.js, REST/GraphQL, microservices, authentication, caching, CI/CD (GitHub Actions, Jenkins), Docker, cloud (AWS/Azure)
- Mobile: React Native
- Architecture: performance, scalability, accessibility (WCAG), testing (Jest, Playwright), monitoring (OpenTelemetry)

**What I’m good at:**

- Building reusable, author‑centric AEM components and content models that scale globally
- Reducing page weight, improving Core Web Vitals, and accelerating build/deploy pipelines
- Designing APIs and integrations that are resilient, secure, and observable
- Leading greenfield builds and modernizing legacy frontends without disrupting delivery

I’m always open to collaborating on AEM platforms, high‑impact frontend performance work, and product builds across web and mobile.

**If you’re hiring:**

- Roles: AEM Engineer/Consultant, Senior Frontend Engineer, Full‑Stack Engineer, Technical Lead
- Engagements: AEM implementations/migrations, performance audits, component libraries/design systems, full‑stack product delivery
